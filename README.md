# Chip8
A Chip8 emulator written in C++

### Features
* Accurate CPU and Memory emulation
* Runs all .c8 games (but not super chip8)

### Motivation
Motivation for undergoing this project was to introduce myself to the concept of emulators. The chip8 is considered an easy to implement gaming system and a good starting place for learning to create emulators for newer and more complex gaming systems.

### Built with
* [SDL](https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php) - Graphics Framework
* [Code Blocks](https://codeblocks.org/) - IDE

### TODO
* Finish Inputs (Because the goal was only to get the emulator running, I did not finish implementing the inputs.)
* Sound Emulation

## Gameplay

![Pong](pong.gif?raw=true "Pong")
